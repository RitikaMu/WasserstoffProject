/* Paragraph */
First I approached the navbar in which I made seperate pages in which I have the used the concepts of router and routes. Then I aprroached the map building in which I installed the package react-leaflet and we have dounloaded the data counties.json from datahub.io. We have applied css to bring the shape of the map. That's all I have done.
